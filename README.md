Daddylive live sports schedule is back.

Follow the usual installation (once daddylive addon is already un-installed):

File Manager -> Add Source -> https://tommhe14.github.io

Install from ZIP -> (plugin.video.daddylive.3.0.2.zip)

Please note;

- due to my moral interest I have decided to block adult channels and VODS.

- I am not the provider of the channels, merely the technical messenger for the community, All credit goes to DrewLive for fixing the channels.

- This will not be perfect, although I do offer a eternal money back guarantee! (lol)

- I welcome issues.
