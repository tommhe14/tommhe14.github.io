Please note;

- due to my moral interest I have decided to block adult channels and VODS.

- I am not the provider of the channels, merely the technical messenger for the community, All credit goes to DrewLive for fixing the channels (discord linked on my github repo)

- This will not be perfect, although I do offer a eternal money back guarantee! (lol)

- I welcome issues.
