For full un-restrictions and trakt implementation consider paying a one off fee of £5 for a private api token.

Once you have received the API token go to Add-ons -> my Add-Ons -> Video Add-ons -> ManeFlix -> Configure -> Apply to "Paid API Key"

If you already have ManeFlix open when applying the API key, restart kodi.

To verify that you have been granted ManeFlix unrestricted, you should see "Link Trakt" on the main menu. Make sure the api key is exact or it will not work. Take good note of this api key as it will clear down once you update to another version in the future.

£5 for all the content you could ever want? How much does netflix cost? how much did renting a dvd movie cost? Or how much does your debrid subscriptions cost?
