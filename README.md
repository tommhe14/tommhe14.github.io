DaddyLive Schedule current unatainable, Hopefully I can get that data in the future.

Please download the latest ZIP 3.0.1, make sure you are installing this when daddylive isn't already installed, and you have done a clean re-start of KODI, this may include clearing your kodi cache but my testing differs on these results.
